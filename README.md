## Overview

LayerPeeler is a framework for layer-wise image vectorization that decomposes images into structured vector representations. The system uses a vision-language model to analyze the image and construct a hierarchical layer graph, identifying the topmost visual elements. These detected elements are then processed by a fine-tuned image diffusion model to generate clean background images with the specified elements removed, enabling precise layer-by-layer vectorization.
